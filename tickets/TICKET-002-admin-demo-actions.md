## Description
Implement the functionality for the quick action buttons on the `/admin/demo` page:
- **Start Session**: Triggers the session start workflow (e.g., runs the session-start CLI or API, updates UI with session status)
- **Create Ticket**: Opens a form or modal to create a new ticket, and on submit, the ticket is added to the system
- **Status Report**: Displays the current project status, including tickets, issues, and test results

## Dependencies
- STORY-002: Admin Demo Quick Actions Functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicking "Start Session" triggers the session start workflow and provides user feedback
- [ ] Clicking "Create Ticket" opens a form/modal, and on submit, the ticket is created and visible in the system
- [ ] Clicking "Status Report" displays the current project status (tickets, issues, test results)
- [ ] All actions provide user feedback (success, error, loading states)
- [ ] Actions are implemented using the appropriate backend logic or CLI integration

## Implementation Notes
- Integrate with existing CLI or backend endpoints for session and ticket management
- Use modals or in-page forms for ticket creation
- Ensure UI updates reflect the result of each action

## Testing
- [ ] All three actions work as described and update the UI appropriately
- [ ] Error and loading states are handled gracefully

## Notes
This ticket implements the workflow integration for the admin demo quick actions. Further tickets may be needed for advanced features or analytics.
