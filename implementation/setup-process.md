# Initial Setup Process

This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a new application using the Coffee Money workflow system.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Git initialized in your project
- Basic familiarity with command line tools

## Step 1: Create Project Structure

Create the essential directory structure for the Coffee Money workflow system:

```bash
# Create project directories
mkdir -p {tickets,stories,issues,docs,utils/commands,utils/lib,logs}

# Create essential files
touch docs/README.md
touch tickets/AGENT-CONTEXT.md
touch stories/README.md
touch issues/README.md
```

**Note**: The `logs/` directory is automatically created by the CLI when needed, but you can create it manually for better organization.

## Step 2: Copy CLI Implementation

Copy the CLI code from `cli-implementation.md` into the appropriate files in your project:

### 2.1 Main CLI Entry Point
Create `utils/cli.js` with the main CLI code.

### 2.2 Logger Utility
Create `utils/lib/logger.js` with the logger implementation.

### 2.3 Core Commands
Create the following command files in `utils/commands/`:
- `session-start.js`
- `status-report.js`
- `list-tickets.js`
- `list-stories.js`
- `list-issues.js`
- `session-wrapup.js`
- `pick-ticket.js`
- `pick-story.js`
- `update-ticket.js`
- `validate-structure.js`
- `test.js`
- `qa-test.js`

## Step 3: Create Initial Documentation

### 3.1 Project README
Create a comprehensive `README.md` in your project root:

```markdown
# Your Project Name

## Overview
Brief description of your project...

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Generate status report
node utils/cli.js status-report
```

## Development Workflow
This project uses the Coffee Money workflow system. See `docs/create-new-app/` for setup instructions.

## Available Commands
- `node utils/cli.js session-start` - Start development session
- `node utils/cli.js status-report` - Generate project status
- `node utils/cli.js list-tickets` - Show all tickets
- `node utils/cli.js pick-ticket` - Select next ticket to work on
```

### 3.2 Agent Context
Create `tickets/AGENT-CONTEXT.md` with initial project context:

```markdown
# Agent Context

## Project Overview
[Your project description]

## Current Status
- Tickets: 0 total, 0 complete, 0 in progress, 0 not started
- Stories: 0 total, 0 complete, 0 in progress, 0 not started
- Issues: 0 open, 0 in progress, 0 resolved

## Ready-to-Pick Tickets
[Will be populated as tickets are created]

## Blocked Tickets
[Will be populated as dependencies are identified]

## Implementation Context
[Technical patterns and conventions for your project]

## Development Environment
[Setup and configuration details]

## Recent Changes
[Latest updates and modifications]

## Last Updated
ðŸ“… [Current Date]
```

### 3.3 Directory READMEs
Create README files for each directory:

#### `tickets/README.md`
```markdown
# Tickets

This directory contains development tickets for the project.

## Format
See `docs/create-new-app/templates.md` for ticket format specifications.

## Naming Convention
- TICKET-001: First ticket
- TICKET-002: Second ticket
- etc.

## Status Tracking
- Not Started: Ticket created but not begun
- In Progress: Active development work
- Review: Ready for code review
- Complete: Finished and deployed
```

#### `stories/README.md`
```markdown
# User Stories

This directory contains user stories for the project.

## Format
See `docs/create-new-app/templates.md` for story format specifications.

## Categories
- Foundation: Core infrastructure
- Authentication: User auth and authorization
- File Management: File upload and storage
- Payment: Payment processing
- Analytics: User analytics
- Admin: Administrative features

## Status Tracking
- Not Started: Story not yet begun
- In Progress: Currently being developed
- Complete: Fully implemented
```

#### `issues/README.md`
```markdown
# Issues

This directory contains bug reports and issues for the project.

## Format
See `docs/create-new-app/templates.md` for issue format specifications.

## Severity Levels
- Critical: System breaking, immediate attention
- High: Major functionality affected
- Medium: Minor functionality affected
- Low: Cosmetic or minor issues

## Status Tracking
- Open: Issue identified and logged
- In Progress: Being investigated or fixed
- Resolved: Issue fixed and verified
```

## Step 4: Test the System

Verify that the CLI system is working correctly:

```bash
# Test CLI help
node utils/cli.js help

# Test session start
node utils/cli.js session-start

# Test status report
node utils/cli.js status-report

# Test ticket listing
node utils/cli.js list-tickets
```

## Step 5: Session Logging Features

The Coffee Money workflow system includes automatic session logging that creates detailed markdown logs for each development session:

### Automatic Session Logs
- **Location**: `logs/session-complete-log-YYYY-MM-DD-XX.md`
- **Auto-numbering**: Sessions numbered sequentially per day (01, 02, 03, etc.)
- **Complete Capture**: All console output during session wrap-up is captured
- **Professional Format**: Clean markdown with sections, metadata, and summaries

### Testing Session Logging
```bash
# Run a session wrap-up to test logging
node utils/cli.js session-wrapup

# Check the logs directory for generated files
ls -la logs/

# View a session log
cat logs/session-complete-log-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-01.md
```

### Log File Structure
Each session log includes:
- **Session Information**: Date, session number, duration, filename
- **Complete Output**: Full console output in code blocks
- **Session Summary**: Key metrics and status indicators
- **Professional Format**: Ready for documentation and review

### Benefits
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all development sessions
- **Debugging**: Easy to review what happened during problematic sessions
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual record of project progress over time
- **Documentation**: Automatic documentation of development activities
- **Professional**: Clean, readable markdown format for easy review

## Step 6: Create Initial Tickets and Stories

### 6.1 Foundation Tickets
Create initial tickets for project setup:

```bash
# Create foundation tickets
touch tickets/TICKET-001-nextjs-foundation.md
touch tickets/TICKET-002-authentication-system.md
touch tickets/TICKET-003-basic-ui-setup.md
```

### 6.2 Foundation Stories
Create initial user stories:

```bash
# Create foundation stories
touch stories/STORY-001-user-can-sign-in.md
touch stories/STORY-002-nextjs-application.md
touch stories/STORY-003-basic-navigation.md
```

## Step 7: Initialize Git Repository

If not already done, initialize and configure Git:

```bash
# Initialize Git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Initial commit
git commit -m "Initial setup with Coffee Money workflow system"

# Create .gitignore
echo "node_modules/
.env
.env.local
logs/
coverage/
.DS_Store" > .gitignore
```

## Step 8: Validate Setup

Run comprehensive validation:

```bash
# Start development session
node utils/cli.js session-start

# Generate status report
node utils/cli.js status-report

# Validate project structure
node utils/cli.js validate-structure
```

## Step 9: Begin Development

Start your first development session:

```bash
# Start session
node utils/cli.js session-start

# Pick a ticket to work on
node utils/cli.js pick-ticket

# Begin development work...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### CLI Commands Not Found
- Ensure all command files are in `utils/commands/`
- Check that command files export `{ description, run }`
- Verify file permissions are executable

#### Missing Dependencies
- Install required Node.js packages
- Check that all import paths are correct
- Verify file structure matches expectations

#### Validation Errors
- Check ticket/story format matches templates
- Ensure all required sections are present
- Verify naming conventions are followed

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the error messages for specific details
2. Review the file formats in `templates.md`
3. Verify your project structure matches the expected layout
4. Run validation commands to identify specific problems
