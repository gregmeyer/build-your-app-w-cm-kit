## Executive Summary
Implement a secure user authentication system that allows users to sign up, sign in, and manage their accounts. This is a foundational feature required for all user-specific functionality in the application.

## Problem Statement
Users need a way to securely access the application and maintain their personal data and preferences across sessions.

### Current State
No authentication system exists. All users are anonymous and cannot save preferences or access personalized features.

### Desired State
Users can create accounts, sign in securely, and have their data persisted across sessions.

## User Stories

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can enter email, password, and name
- [ ] System validates email format and password strength
- [ ] User receives confirmation email
- [ ] Account is created after email verification
- [ ] User is automatically signed in after verification

**Story Points:** 8
**Priority:** High

### STORY-002: User Sign In

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- User registration with email verification
- Secure password authentication
- Password reset functionality
- Session management
- Profile management
- Account deletion

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Authentication requests must complete within 2 seconds
- **Security:** Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt, minimum 8 characters
- **Usability:** Clear error messages and intuitive UI
- **Compatibility:** Works across all modern browsers

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing Next.js 15 application
- Must use NextAuth.js for authentication
- Must support email-based authentication only (no social logins initially)

### Implementation Notes
- Use NextAuth.js for authentication framework
- Store user data in database (PostgreSQL recommended)
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- Implement JWT tokens for session management
- Use email service (SendGrid or similar) for verification emails

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Registration Conversion Rate:** >70% of visitors who start registration complete it
- **Authentication Success Rate:** >95% of login attempts succeed
- **Password Reset Completion Rate:** >80% of reset requests are completed

### User Metrics
- **Daily Active Users:** Track authenticated user sessions
- **Session Duration:** Average time users spend signed in
- **Feature Adoption:** Usage of authenticated-only features

### Business Metrics
- **User Retention:** 30-day retention rate for new registrations
- **Support Tickets:** Reduction in authentication-related support requests

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Database setup and configuration
- Email service integration
- UI component library

### External Dependencies
- NextAuth.js library
- Email service provider (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
- Database service (if using cloud database)

### Blockers
- None currently identified

## Timeline

### Milestones
- **Milestone 1:** 2025-06-30 - Basic registration and login
- **Milestone 2:** 2025-07-07 - Password reset functionality
- **Milestone 3:** 2025-07-14 - Profile management and testing

### Estimated Timeline
- **Development:** 3 weeks
- **Testing:** 1 week
- **Deployment:** 1 week

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Email delivery issues:** Mitigation: Use reliable email service with fallback
- **Security vulnerabilities:** Mitigation: Follow OWASP guidelines and security testing

### Medium Risk
- **User adoption:** Mitigation: Clear onboarding and user education

### Low Risk
- **Performance issues:** Mitigation: Load testing and optimization

## Notes
This PRD serves as the foundation for all user-specific features. The authentication system should be designed to be extensible for future features like social login, two-factor authentication, and role-based access control.
