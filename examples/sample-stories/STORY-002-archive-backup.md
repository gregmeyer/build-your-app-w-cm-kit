## Description
As a developer, I want to create backups of my project configuration so that I can safely experiment with changes and preserve working states.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given I'm working on a CM Kit project, when I run `node utils/cli.js archive-config`, then a backup is created in the `archive/` directory
- [ ] Given I create an archive, when I check the archive directory, then I see a timestamped folder with my project files
- [ ] Given I create an archive, when I open the archive, then I find all essential project files (excluding node_modules)
- [ ] Given I create an archive, when I check the metadata, then I see current git branch, commit, and project information
- [ ] Given I create an archive, when I read the README, then I find clear restoration instructions
- [ ] Given I want to restore from an archive, when I follow the instructions, then I can restore my project to the archived state

## Story Points
3

## Dependencies
- TICKET-001: Next.js Foundation Setup
- TICKET-002: Archive Configuration System

## Implementation Notes
- Archive should exclude node_modules and build artifacts
- Include source code, configuration files, and documentation
- Generate comprehensive metadata with git information
- Provide step-by-step restoration instructions
- Use ISO timestamp format for directory names

## Testing Scenarios
- [ ] Archive command creates backup successfully
- [ ] Archive contains all expected files and directories
- [ ] Metadata file includes accurate project information
- [ ] Restoration instructions are clear and actionable
- [ ] Archive can be restored to working project state

## Notes
This story provides safety and confidence for developers to experiment with changes.
