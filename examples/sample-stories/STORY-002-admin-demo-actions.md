## As an
Admin user

## I want to
Use the quick action buttons on the /admin/demo page to:
- Start a development session
- Create a new ticket
- View a status report

## So that
I can efficiently manage project workflow directly from the admin demo interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicking "Start Session" triggers the session start workflow (e.g., runs the session-start CLI or API, updates UI with session status)
- [ ] Clicking "Create Ticket" opens a form or modal to create a new ticket, and on submit, the ticket is added to the system
- [ ] Clicking "Status Report" displays the current project status, including tickets, issues, and test results
- [ ] All actions provide user feedback (success, error, loading states)
- [ ] Actions are implemented using the appropriate backend logic or CLI integration
- [ ] Navigation provides access to both full demo and blank page example

## Notes
- This story covers only the UI and workflow integration for the three quick actions on the /admin/demo page.
- Further stories may be needed for advanced ticket management or session analytics.
- Users can choose between comprehensive demo (/admin/demo) and simple blank page (/admin/blank) based on their needs.
