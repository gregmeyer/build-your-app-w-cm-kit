node utils/cli.js session-wrapup                            # Complete session with validation
```

### üìä **Reporting & Status**
```bash
node utils/cli.js status-report                             # Generate project status report
node utils/cli.js sprint-report                             # Generate comprehensive sprint report
```

### üé´ **Ticket & Issue Management**
```bash
node utils/cli.js list-tickets                              # List all tickets
node utils/cli.js list-stories                              # List all user stories
node utils/cli.js list-issues                               # List all issues
node utils/cli.js pick-ticket                               # Pick ticket to work on
node utils/cli.js pick-story                                # Pick story to work on
node utils/cli.js update-ticket --id=TICKET-001 --status="In Progress"  # Update ticket
```

### ‚úÖ **Validation & Quality**
```bash
node utils/cli.js validate-structure                        # Validate project structure
node utils/cli.js validate-docs                             # Validate documentation
node utils/cli.js check-deps                                # Check dependencies
node utils/cli.js qa-test                                   # Run comprehensive QA tests
```

### üß™ **Testing**
```bash
node utils/cli.js test                                      # Run tests and utilities
```

### üì¶ **Archiving & Demo Management**
```bash
node utils/cli.js archive-project --type=full              # Archive project components
node utils/cli.js remove-demo                               # Remove demo content

```

### üìö **Documentation**
```bash
node utils/cli.js validate-docs                             # Validate documentation completeness
```

For complete CLI documentation, see [docs/cli](src/app/docs/cli/page.tsx).

## ü§ñ Automated Setup (Recommended)

**For the fastest setup experience, use the automated script: [setup-automated.js](setup-automated.js)**

This script automates all the steps in the getting-started guide and can be run directly by Cursor:

```bash
# Run the automated setup script
node automation/setup-automated.js
```

**What the automated script does:**
- ‚úÖ Checks prerequisites (Node.js, npm, Git)
- ‚úÖ Creates complete project structure
- ‚úÖ Installs all dependencies (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v3, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Extracts and configures the CLI system
- ‚úÖ Creates all configuration files (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, Jest)
- ‚úÖ Sets up clean homepage with admin demo
- ‚úÖ Creates comprehensive documentation pages (CLI, Workflow, Components, API)
- ‚úÖ Creates error handling components (error.tsx, not-found.tsx, global-error.tsx)
- ‚úÖ Implements hydration-safe layout and components
- ‚úÖ Creates initial ticket and agent context
- ‚úÖ Initializes Git repository
- ‚úÖ Tests the setup
- ‚úÖ Provides next steps and useful commands

**Perfect for Cursor AI workflow:** Simply ask Cursor to run this script in a new project directory, and it will set up everything automatically!

> **üéØ Complete Setup:** The automated setup script creates ALL of the features listed below - the clean homepage, admin demo, documentation pages, legal pages, UI components, error handling, and more. Just run the script and you'll have a fully functional application ready for development!

## üé® What Comes Out of the Box
